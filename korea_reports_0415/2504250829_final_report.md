# South Korea's Political and Economic Landscape: A 2025 Outlook

As South Korea approaches a pivotal presidential election, the nation's political and economic future hangs in the balance. Leading candidate Lee Jae-myung's commitment to revising the commercial act and addressing the "Korea Discount" reflects a broader ambition to enhance corporate governance and boost market confidence. Amidst a backdrop of intense political maneuvering and strategic alliances, this report examines the potential shifts in South Korea's trade policies and economic strategies, offering insights into the implications for regional stability and global market dynamics.


## Historical Context & Recent Developments

The political landscape of South Korea has been shaped by a series of significant events and developments over the past few decades, culminating in the current political climate marked by a snap presidential election. The roots of the current situation can be traced back to the late 20th century, when South Korea transitioned from military rule to a democratic government. This period saw the establishment of a robust democratic framework, although it has been periodically tested by political scandals and economic challenges.

In recent years, South Korea has experienced political turbulence, notably with the declaration of martial law, which led to a constitutional crisis and the impeachment of a sitting president. The martial law declaration was ostensibly a response to escalating security concerns, although critics argue it was a politically motivated move by the Yoon Suk Yeol to consolidate power amidst growing public dissent. The impeachment process highlighted deep divisions within the political establishment and underscored the fragility of South Korea's democratic institutions.

The ruling party's concerns were not entirely unfounded, as South Korea has faced genuine security threats, both domestically and from its northern neighbor, North Korea. However, the extent of these threats and their use as justification for martial law have been subjects of intense debate. The political insecurity within the ruling party was exacerbated by internal power struggles and a loss of public confidence, which some analysts suggest were the immediate drivers for the drastic measures taken.

As South Korea approaches the snap election, the political landscape remains fluid, with candidates vying to address both domestic concerns and broader geopolitical challenges. The outcome of this election will likely have significant implications for South Korea's future political stability and its role on the international stage.

## Navigating Political Turbulence: Implications of South Korea's Snap Election on Economic and Security Dynamics
### GPR Abstract

The December 3 declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk yeol—ostensibly to counter perceived security threats—was widely condemned as a constitutional overreach, sparking mass protests and deepening political fissures. That move precipitated his impeachment by the National Assembly, which the Constitutional Court upheld in April 2025, creating a leadership vacuum. To resolve the crisis and restore legitimacy, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025.

The race now pits three principal parties against each other: the liberal Democratic Party; the conservative People Power Party; and smaller centrist/progressive party like the New Reform Party. 
DPK is set to finalize their presidential nominee on April 27th. It is already very likely that Lee Jae-myung will the presidential candidate as he is currently polling close to 90% within the DPK [source 1]. On the other hand, PPP still has 4 major candidates to decide from and will nomiate one of the following candidates on May 3rd: Han Dong-hoon(19%), Hong Joon-pyo (16%), Kim Moon-soo (14%) and Ahn Cheol-soo (12%) [source 2]. PPP also has to be conscious of Lee Jun-seok, who gave up the PPP leader position during Yoon's presidency. While his polling results were in the double digits under most likely presidential nominee scnarios, as the PPP is narrowing down on their nominee, he has faced a slight decline in support. Whether he chooses endorse the PPP candidate by June 3rd could significantly sway the results [source 3].
