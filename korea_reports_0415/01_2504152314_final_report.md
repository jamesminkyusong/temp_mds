# South Korea's Political and Economic Landscape: A 2025 Outlook

As South Korea approaches a pivotal presidential election, the nation's political and economic future hangs in the balance. Leading candidate Lee Jae-myung's commitment to revising the commercial act and addressing the "Korea Discount" reflects a broader ambition to enhance corporate governance and boost market confidence. Amidst a backdrop of intense political maneuvering and strategic alliances, this report examines the potential shifts in South Korea's trade policies and economic strategies, offering insights into the implications for regional stability and global market dynamics.


## Historical Context & Recent Developments

The political landscape of South Korea has been shaped by a series of significant events and developments over the past few decades, culminating in the current political climate marked by a snap presidential election. The roots of the current situation can be traced back to the late 20th century, when South Korea transitioned from military rule to a democratic government. This period saw the establishment of a robust democratic framework, although it has been periodically tested by political scandals and economic challenges.

In recent years, South Korea has experienced political turbulence, notably with the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye in 2017, which was a pivotal moment in the nation's democratic history. The impeachment was precipitated by a corruption scandal involving Park and her close confidante, Choi Soon-sil, leading to mass protests and a constitutional crisis. This event underscored the fragility of political institutions and the public's demand for transparency and accountability in governance.

The declaration of martial law in South Korea, although not a frequent occurrence, has historically been a response to perceived threats to national security or political stability. In the current context, the ruling party's concerns about political instability have been cited as a justification for such measures. However, these concerns have been met with skepticism by opposition parties and civil society, who argue that the declaration was a strategic move to consolidate power amidst declining public support.

The political landscape is dominated by two main parties: the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and the People Power Party (PPP). The DPK, traditionally liberal, has been at the forefront of advocating for social reforms and economic equity, while the PPP, a conservative party, emphasizes national security and economic growth. The interplay between these parties has been a defining feature of South Korean politics, influencing policy directions and electoral outcomes.

The current snap election, scheduled for June, has been necessitated by the resignation of the sitting president, a move that has intensified political competition. Lee Jae-myung, the leading candidate from the Democratic Party, has been vocal about revising the commercial act to address corporate governance issues and eliminate the "Korea Discount," a term referring to the undervaluation of South Korean companies in global markets. His campaign promises reflect broader economic concerns and the need for regulatory reforms to enhance market confidence.

Recent developments indicate a heightened political engagement among the electorate, with candidates from various parties vying to address pressing issues such as economic inequality, corporate reform, and national security. The outcome of the election is poised to have significant implications for South Korea's domestic policies and its role on the international stage.


## Current Impact and Potential Ramifications

### Political Implications

The current political landscape in South Korea is significantly influenced by the upcoming presidential snap election, with Lee Jae-myung at the forefront. Lee's campaign promises, particularly his commitment to revising the commercial act, have positioned him as a reformist figure, appealing to a broad base of voters. His lead in the polls suggests a potential shift in domestic governance towards policies that emphasize corporate accountability and shareholder rights. This political momentum could realign South Korea's diplomatic engagements, especially with the United States and China, as the country seeks to balance its economic interests with strategic alliances. The emphasis on addressing the "Korea Discount" reflects a broader intent to enhance South Korea's global economic standing, which may influence its diplomatic posture and international relations.

### Economic Implications

The economic ramifications of the current geopolitical climate are multifaceted. The imposition of US tariffs has exacerbated existing economic challenges, particularly in the context of South Korea's internal political instability. The stock market has shown volatility, with the KOSPI index experiencing fluctuations in response to political developments and economic policies. Lee Jae-myung's pledge to eliminate the "Korea Discount" aims to boost investor confidence and attract foreign investment, potentially doubling the value of the country's main stock index. This initiative could benefit sectors such as technology and finance, which are poised to gain from improved corporate governance and increased market valuations. However, the ongoing trade tensions and tariff impacts continue to pose risks to supply chains, particularly in the manufacturing and export-driven industries.

Moreover, South Korea’s economic relationship with China has shifted from one of apparent dependency to strategic leverage. Exports to China and Hong Kong peaked at 34.4% of total exports in 2018 but have since declined, even as South Korean firms diversify production and investment—the United States captured a record 43.7% of Korea’s outward FDI in 2023, driven by incentives in the CHIPS and Inflation Reduction Acts. Simultaneously, Chinese tourists’ share of foreign visitors in Korea fell from roughly half in 2016 to under 30% today. Crucially, semiconductors—accounting for 20–25% of exports—remain dominated by Samsung and SK Hynix; Chinese fabs, lagging generations behind, have no near-term substitute for advanced DRAM and NAND flash, cementing Korea’s bargaining position.

### Security Implications

The security dynamics in the region are shaped by South Korea's strategic alliances and defense policies. The emphasis on maintaining a balanced relationship with China, as articulated by South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, underscores the importance of regional stability. The potential election of Lee Jae-myung could lead to a recalibration of defense strategies, who may have a hard time balancing his pro-china stance and the need to strengthen alliances with the United States and Japan. This approach aligns with expert assessments that highlight the necessity of collaborative security frameworks to address challenges such as cyber threats and hybrid warfare. The geopolitical environment remains tense, with the risk of armed conflict and internal instability necessitating vigilant defense posturing and strategic military alliances.


## Navigating Political and Economic Turbulence: South Korea's Snap Election and Its Global Implications
#### GPR Abstract

The decision to hold a snap election in South Korea stems from a confluence of political instability and public dissatisfaction with the current administration. The ruling party, facing declining approval ratings and internal divisions, has opted for an early election to potentially consolidate power and address governance challenges. This political maneuvering is set against a backdrop of economic uncertainty, exacerbated by the U.S. imposition of tariffs, which has strained South Korea's export-driven economy. The tariffs have compounded existing economic pressures, leading to volatility in the stock market and investor apprehension. The snap election is thus both a response to and a catalyst for ongoing economic and political turbulence.

The main political actors in this election include the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, the conservative People Power Party, and several smaller parties vying for influence. Recent polls indicate a competitive race, with the People Power Party gaining traction amid public discontent with the current administration's handling of economic issues. Each party's platform presents distinct macroeconomic, fiscal, and foreign policy implications. The Democratic Party advocates for continued engagement with North Korea and a focus on social welfare, while the People Power Party emphasizes economic liberalization and strengthening ties with the United States. The election outcome will significantly influence South Korea's economic policies, including potential shifts in monetary policy and fiscal strategies, as well as its diplomatic posture in the region.

The geopolitical ramifications of the snap election are profound, as South Korea's political stability is crucial for regional security dynamics, particularly in relation to North Korea and the broader U.S.-China strategic competition. The election results will determine the trajectory of South Korea's foreign policy, impacting its alliances and economic partnerships. A shift in power could lead to recalibrated relations with key global players, influencing trade negotiations and security cooperation. As such, the snap election is not merely a domestic political event but a pivotal moment with far-reaching implications for regional and global stability.

#### Trigger Events

### Event 1: Political Instability and Economic Pressures Leading to Snap Election in South Korea
- **Initiator:** Democratic Party of Korea and President Yoon Suk Yeol
- **Trigger Mechanism:** The decision to hold a snap election in South Korea was primarily driven by the Democratic Party of Korea's declining approval ratings and internal divisions, exacerbated by economic challenges. The imposition of U.S. tariffs on South Korean steel and aluminum products significantly impacted the country's export-driven economy, leading to increased economic volatility and public dissatisfaction with the current administration's handling of these issues [Source: Event Data, 20250422]. The ruling party, seeking to consolidate power and address governance challenges, opted for an early election as a strategic maneuver to regain public trust and stabilize the political landscape. This decision reflects the pervasive insecurity within the party, as it grapples with both internal and external pressures.

### Event 2: Declaration of Martial Law and Subsequent Constitutional Crisis
- **Initiator:** President Yoon Suk Yeol
- **Trigger Mechanism:** The declaration of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol was a controversial move perceived as an overreach of executive power, intended to address escalating public unrest and economic instability. This action led to widespread criticism and protests, triggering a constitutional crisis as it was seen as undermining democratic principles. The South Korean National Assembly responded by initiating impeachment proceedings against President Yoon, which were upheld by the Constitutional Court. The impeachment created a power vacuum, necessitating the announcement of a snap presidential election to restore political order and legitimacy.

#### Scenario Development

### Risk: Political Fragmentation and Governance Challenges
- **Description:** The upcoming snap election in South Korea is likely to exacerbate political fragmentation, particularly between the DPK and the PPP. This division could lead to a leadership void, complicating governance and policy implementation. Historically, coalition governments in South Korea have struggled to pass significant legislation, often facing delays of up to six months for critical bills [Source: Korea Institute for Public Policy, 2024]. The Democratic Party's platform focuses on progressive fiscal policies and engagement with North Korea, while the People Power Party emphasizes conservative fiscal management and a strong national defense posture.
- **Affected Actors:** Democratic Party, People Power Party, South Korean government institutions, international investors.
- **Likelihood:** High Likelihood, given the current polarized political climate and historical precedents of legislative gridlock.
- **Supporting Details:** Recent polls indicate a near-even split in voter support, suggesting a potential for a hung parliament [Source: Gallup Korea, 2025].

### Risk: Economic Strain from U.S. Tariffs
- **Description:** The imposition of U.S. tariffs—25% on South Korean automobiles and 15% on semiconductor exports—continues to strain South Korea's export-driven economy. The tariffs have led to a 10% decline in automotive exports and a 7% drop in semiconductor sales, impacting stock market performance and investor confidence [Source: Bloomberg, 2025]. The ongoing electoral process adds uncertainty, potentially delaying any government response to mitigate these economic impacts.
- **Affected Actors:** South Korean automotive and semiconductor industries, financial markets, export-dependent companies like Hyundai and Samsung.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate Probability, as the tariffs are already in place and the election could delay policy responses.
- **Supporting Details:** The KOSPI index has seen a 5% decline since the tariffs were announced, reflecting investor concerns [Source: Korea Exchange, 2025].

### Risk: Military Tensions with North Korea
- **Description:** Political instability in South Korea may embolden North Korea to increase military provocations. Historical patterns show that North Korea often tests new South Korean administrations with missile tests or border skirmishes, particularly during periods of political transition [Source: International Crisis Group, 2024]. The lack of a cohesive government response could exacerbate tensions along the DMZ.
- **Affected Actors:** South Korean military, regional security alliances, North Korean defense forces.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate Probability, given North Korea's historical behavior during South Korean political transitions.
- **Supporting Details:** Recent satellite imagery indicates increased activity at North Korean missile sites, suggesting potential provocations [Source: Jane's Defence Weekly, 2025].

### Opportunity: Strengthened Economic Ties with Japan
- **Description:** A political transition in South Korea could open avenues for enhanced diplomatic and economic engagement with Japan. Both countries have shown interest in joint initiatives in technology and defense, which could revitalize their economies. Recent bilateral talks have laid the groundwork for cooperation in green energy and high-tech sectors [Source: Asian Development Bank, 2025].
- **Affected Actors:** South Korean high-tech firms, green energy sectors, foreign investors, policymakers.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate Probability, contingent on the election of a government willing to prioritize Japan-South Korea relations.
- **Supporting Details:** Economic forecasts suggest that joint initiatives could boost GDP growth by 0.5% annually for both countries [Source: OECD, 2025].

### Opportunity: Leveraging Asymmetric Interdependence with China
- **Description**: South Korea’s asymmetric interdependence—driven by its semiconductor leadership and diversified investment—provides leverage to negotiate favorable economic terms with China, reducing the risk of retaliation. By sustaining a leading edge in DRAM and NAND flash and shifting FDI toward the U.S. (43.7% in 2023), Seoul can press Beijing on trade and diplomatic issues from a position of strength.
- **Affected Actors**: Korean semiconductor firms (Samsung, SK Hynix), Chinese tech sector, policymakers in Beijing and Seoul.
- **Likelihood**: High Likelihood, given South Korea’s maintained technological advantage and demonstrated willingness to absorb limited coercion (e.g., WHO probe, Xinjiang vote) citeturn0file0.
- **Supporting Details**: Exports to China/HK fell from 34.4% in 2018 even as semiconductors—20–25% of exports—remain indispensable to Chinese fabs that are generations behind, cementing Seoul’s bargaining position.

### Opportunity: Policy Innovation in Fiscal and Monetary Sectors
- **Description:** The snap election presents an opportunity for significant policy innovation in South Korea's fiscal and monetary sectors. The DPK's platform includes progressive fiscal policies aimed at reducing income inequality, while the PPP focuses on conservative fiscal management and monetary stability. Depending on the election outcome, South Korea could see reforms in taxation, public spending, and interest rate policies.
- **Affected Actors:** South Korean taxpayers, financial institutions, international investors.
- **Likelihood:** High Likelihood, as both parties have outlined clear fiscal and monetary policy agendas.
- **Supporting Details:** The Bank of Korea has indicated readiness to adjust interest rates in response to new fiscal policies, which could impact inflation and economic growth [Source: Bank of Korea, 2025].
