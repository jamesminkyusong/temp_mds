### Trigger Events
- **Event:** Impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol and the subsequent declaration of a snap presidential election in South Korea.
- **Initiator:** South Korean National Assembly and Constitutional Court.
- **Trigger Mechanism:** The impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol was initiated by the South Korean National Assembly following his controversial declaration of martial law in December 2024. This action was perceived as an overreach of executive power, leading to widespread public and political backlash. The Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment, creating a power vacuum and necessitating a snap presidential election scheduled for June 3, 2025. This event is significant as it has plunged South Korea into political instability, affecting its economic and diplomatic engagements, particularly with the United States.

### GPR Abstract
The impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has catalyzed a period of political and economic uncertainty in the country, with profound implications for regional and global dynamics. The declaration of martial law by Yoon, intended to suppress opposition, backfired, leading to his removal from office and triggering a snap presidential election. This political upheaval has strained South Korea's relations with the United States, complicating negotiations over tariffs and defense cost-sharing. The upcoming election, a contest between the conservative People Power Party and the liberal Democratic Party, will be pivotal in determining South Korea's future domestic and foreign policies. The economic ramifications are significant, with declining consumer confidence and business sentiment, exacerbated by U.S. tariffs on key South Korean exports. The shipbuilding sector, however, presents a potential opportunity for negotiation leverage with the U.S. The security landscape is also affected, with concerns about internal stability and the potential for North Korean provocations. The outcome of the election will shape South Korea's ability to navigate these challenges and redefine its role in the Indo-Pacific region.
