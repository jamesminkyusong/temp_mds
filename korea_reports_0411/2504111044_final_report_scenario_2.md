### GPR Abstract
The impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has plunged the nation into a period of political instability, with a snap presidential election set for June 3, 2025. This development comes at a critical juncture as South Korea grapples with economic challenges exacerbated by U.S. tariffs under President Donald Trump. The political vacuum has hindered South Korea's ability to effectively engage in diplomatic negotiations, leaving it vulnerable to further economic disruptions. The election is expected to be a contest between the conservative People Power Party and the liberal Democratic Party, led by Lee Jae-myung, who is currently the frontrunner. The outcome will be pivotal in determining South Korea's future domestic policies and international relations, particularly its approach to U.S. trade policies and regional diplomacy.

The geopolitical ramifications of this political upheaval are profound. The lack of stable leadership has strained South Korea's relations with the U.S., complicating efforts to address spiraling tariffs and defense cost-sharing issues. Domestically, the crisis has led to a decline in consumer and business confidence, threatening key sectors such as automobiles and semiconductors. The shipbuilding industry, however, presents a potential opportunity for negotiation leverage with the U.S. As South Korea navigates this turbulent period, the election outcome will shape its ability to address these challenges and redefine its role in the global economic and security landscape.
