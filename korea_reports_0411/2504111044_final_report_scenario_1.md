- **Event:** Impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol and the subsequent declaration of a snap presidential election in South Korea.
- **Initiator:** South Korean National Assembly and Constitutional Court.
- **Trigger Mechanism:** The impeachment was triggered by President Yoon's declaration of martial law in December 2024, which was perceived as an overreach of executive power.

### GPR Abstract
The impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has plunged the nation into a period of political instability, with significant implications for both domestic and international arenas. The declaration of martial law by Yoon, intended to suppress opposition, backfired, leading to his removal and the announcement of a snap presidential election. This political upheaval occurs amidst economic challenges, including U.S. tariffs that threaten key South Korean industries such as semiconductors and automobiles. The upcoming election is pivotal, as it will determine the future direction of South Korea's domestic policies and international relations, particularly with the United States. The political landscape is deeply polarized, with the conservative People Power Party and the liberal Democratic Party, led by Lee Jae-myung, vying for power. The outcome will shape South Korea's ability to address economic challenges and redefine its foreign policy stance.

The geopolitical ramifications are profound, as the power vacuum and lack of stable leadership complicate South Korea's diplomatic engagements, particularly with the U.S. The strained relations over tariffs and defense cost-sharing could impact the strategic military alliance between the two countries. Additionally, the internal instability raises concerns about security, with the potential for civil unrest and increased risk of military provocations from North Korea. As South Korea navigates this turbulent period, stakeholders must prioritize diplomatic engagement and multilateral cooperation to mitigate risks and ensure regional stability.
