South Korea is navigating a profound political crisis following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office after declaring martial law. This upheaval has not only destabilized the nation's political landscape but also poses significant challenges to its economic and trade relations, particularly with the United States. As South Korea prepares for a snap presidential election, the new leadership will face the daunting task of restoring stability while addressing escalating trade tensions and security concerns amid U.S. tariffs and diplomatic pressures.


## Historical Context & Recent Developments

The political landscape of South Korea has been marked by significant upheaval in recent years, culminating in the impeachment and removal of President Yoon Suk Yeol in April 2025. This event is reminiscent of the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in 2017, which similarly led to a period of political instability and a subsequent snap election. The impeachment of President Yoon was precipitated by his controversial declaration of martial law in December 2024, a move that was widely perceived as an overreach of executive power and a direct challenge to South Korea's democratic institutions.

The imposition of martial law by President Yoon was justified by his administration as a necessary measure to counteract what he claimed were threats from opposition parties allegedly sympathetic to North Korea. However, this action was met with widespread domestic and international condemnation, leading to mass protests and a swift response from the National Assembly, which voted to impeach him. The Constitutional Court's decision to uphold the impeachment reflects a robust judicial response to perceived executive overreach, underscoring the resilience of South Korea's democratic framework.

The political crisis has unfolded against a backdrop of economic challenges, including tensions with the United States over trade policies. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on South Korean goods has exacerbated economic pressures, particularly in key sectors such as semiconductors and automotive manufacturing. These economic strains have been compounded by South Korea's designation as a "sensitive country" by the U.S. Department of Energy, a status that threatens to disrupt scientific and technological collaborations.

In the immediate aftermath of President Yoon's removal, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo has assumed the role of acting president, with a presidential election mandated to occur within 60 days. This period of transition presents both risks and opportunities for South Korea, as the new administration will need to navigate complex geopolitical dynamics, including North Korea's military provocations and China's diplomatic maneuvers, while also addressing domestic economic challenges. The outcome of the upcoming election will be pivotal in determining South Korea's strategic direction and its ability to restore political stability and economic growth.
